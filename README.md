## 🎯 How It Works  

1. **Detect License Plate**:

3. **Update Logs**:  
   - 📥 **Entry Log**: Marks the vehicle’s entry time.  
   - 📤 **Exit Log**: Updates upon departure, calculating the parking duration and fees.  

4. **Data Storage**:  
   All records are securely saved in the database for future reference and analytics.
